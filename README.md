# odin-recipes
This repository serves as a place to store my first TOP 
project. In this project called "odin-recipes" I will test 
my knowledge about basic html. This should include the writing of a general html boilerplate, adding paragraphs, adding bolt and
italic text, adding ordered and unordered lists, adding images and most importantly adding links to other webpages.
